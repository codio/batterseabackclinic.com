<h3>Arthritic Symptoms</h3>
<p>There are many types of arthritis. Here we consider osteoarthritis or spondylitis &#150; the degenerative effects caused by wear and tear. Some studies suggest a genetic link, but others show only a mechanical misuse of the joints as the primary cause.</p>
<p>Around half the population suffers from arthritis passed the age of retirement, however the wear and tear can begin many years before.</p>
<p>The symptoms may only start as stiffness and discomfort and, if allowed to continue untreated, predispose patients to arthritis. Patients in their 40&rsquo;s who come to the Clinic with a 10 year history of periodic back pain after an injury can show arthritic changes on their x-ray.</p>
<p>Authorities agree that chiropractic management of arthritis needs to be multi-faceted. It is most effect when combined with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gentle exercise and mobilisation programme</li>
<li>Nutrition and supplement advise such as glucosamine sulphate</li>
<li>Lifestyle changes, e.g. avoiding prolonged sitting</li>
</ul>
<p>The long term use of anti-inflammatories (NSAID&rsquo;S) to manage arthritis is openly contested due to the potential further damage to the joints. That is why chiropractic aims to help your function rather than mask your pain.</p>

<h4>Case Study</h4>
<p>Peter, a 44 year old recruitment consultant, suffered acute low back pain. His history told of previous episodes over the last twelve years. Fifteen years ago Peter had had a rugby injury which stopped him playing for two months but his back had never been &lsquo;right&rsquo; since.</p>
<p>The only clue that Peter had a low back condition was that he was unable to touch his toes and his back was always stiff getting out of bed and after sitting for a long time.</p>
<p>The x-ray of his lumbar spine showed moderate levels of wear and tear in the bone and the disc.</p>
<p>Peter was surprised by the findings as he thought getting stiff and having a slightly &lsquo;dodgy&rsquo; back was normal at his age.</p>
<p>His pain has been resolved and Peter is now doing exercises to strengthen his back and improve his flexibility.</p>
<p>He understands he will always have to look after his back with maintenance chiropractic care. Coupled with re-habilitation exercises he can reverse some of the changes in the cartilage of the spinal joints.</p>
