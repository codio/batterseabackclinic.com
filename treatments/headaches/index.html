<h3>Headaches</h3>
<p>When headaches are triggered by food or bright light and are eased through vomiting, you are probably suffering a classic migraine.</p>
<p>However, if you experience repeated headaches making you tired and/or nauseous, the most common cause of your condition will be located in your neck. In the same way pinched nerves in the neck can cause neck pain, pinched nerves at the top of your neck can cause headaches. These are known as cervicogenic headaches.</p>
<p>Cervicogenic headaches can be felt at the back of the head but more commonly on the side of your forehead. When symptoms are at their worst, pain goes behind the eye and you may feel nauseous and dizzy.</p>
<p>Chiropractors use an accurate, modified technique to adjust the neck and release the pinching of the nerves. It is an extremely safe form of treatment with a lower risk to your health than taking an over the counter anti-inflammatory drug.</p>
<p>There are many causes of headaches and a thorough examination is conducted before being treated. If the neck is not the cause of the headache, you will be referred back to the relevant medical professional.</p>

<h4>Case Study</h4>
<p>Mary, a 40 year old administrator had a five year history of headaches. Some weeks she suffered one episode yet other weeks four or five. The pain was on the side of her forehead, less often the back and top of the skull making focusing on her computer screen difficult.</p>
<p>She took pain killers that dulled her symptoms, but had also to take a day off work every two months.</p>
<p>When Mary was examined she had tender points where the back of the skull joins the neck. This reminded Mary her neck was uncomfortable and tired when she sat at the computer.</p>
<p>Mary was diagnosed as suffering from cervicogenic headaches &#150; the pinching of the nerve in the neck referring throbbing pain to the head.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s condition was successfully treated at the Clinic and her recovery was re-enforced by learning how to sit correctly at the computer.</p>
